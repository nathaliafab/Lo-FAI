# Lo-FAI

*My main goal is to produce lo-fi music using artificial intelligence and make a small gallery of artifacts. I've always loved this genre and AI is my latest interest. So why not?* :relaxed:
*Everything possible in this repository will be generated through AI. Enjoy!*

### Let's begin with a short description.

I really like this one. It wasn't the first thing first that came up, but it was love at first... variations. And it does say "Lo-FAI" out loud!

## Here comes the first try.
Okay, this wasn't my first try at all. I wanted to make a music from scratch first, but I was struggling a little with finding the right ways to do that. So, I thought: "I can make a playlist with all songs curated by ChatGPT!"

And that is what I tried to do. Here's the process:
| Aesthetic description to a youtube video that is a playlist of lo-fi music tracks. Having an introduction, timestamps for each track, link to github repo (nathaliafab/Lo-FAI) and a final message saying that this message was written using ChatGPT and asking people to like and subscribe. Include cute emojis.| [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) |

> 🎵 Welcome to my lo-fi music playlist 🎵
>

> 
> 1. 0:00 - "Coffee Shop Jazz" 🎷
> 2. 2:45 - "Rainy Day Blues" 🌧️

Pretty nice, isn't it? But those tracks don't even exist. So I keep trying:

I won't show all my attempts, but I tried A LOT; ChatGPT is simply not a big fan of lo-fi hip hop. As you can see, they just made things up. So, let's move on for now. What about the title?

| Write a YouTube title for a playlist of lo-fi music. Include cute emojis.| [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) |
|----|----|

> Here's a title that incorporates cute emojis: "Lo-Fi Cuddles 🎧🐻 - A Cozy Mix 🎹❤️". The emojis convey a sense of warmth and comfort, making them a fitting choice for a lo-fi music playlist. The word "cuddles" implies a feeling of closeness and comfort, adding to the overall theme of the playlist.

OMG. "Lo-Fi Cuddles" is too cute, I HAD TO choose that title, even though there were other options, like "Lo-FAI's Lo-Fi Escape 🌿🎧" and "Lofi Melodies to Soothe Your Soul 🎧✨ - A Blissful Instrumental Mix 🎹🎶", this one just caught my eye.

*Now we have a cute title and a nice description. The most important thing is still missing!*

Well, it's just too difficult to make ChatGPT work for me (THE AUDACITY!), so I just used an online playlist generator. Since my theme is "cute lo-fi", I chose the track "Azalea Town" by Mikel to inspire the playlist. :smile:
